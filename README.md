# Team Agreement

Luis Sandoval | Sarah Teklemariam | Alan Monkman

## Cooperation Plan

- What are the key strengths of each person on the team?

  - Luis: CSS

  - Sarah: HTML/CSS

  - Alan: HTML/JS(math)

- How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?

  - Because each of us specialize in different areas, we are able to easily split responsibilities between eachother.

- In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?

  - Confidence/public speaking, analytic thinking and problem solving, verbalizing ideas and thoughts.

- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

  - COMMUNICATION. Frequent "meet-ups", like before, during, and after class.

## Conflict Plan

- What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

  - Communicate any issues if they arise to prevent further issues. Put yourself in other persons shoes. Majority rule.

- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

  - Remind the team members of the roles that they were assigned.

- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

  - Approach eachother with the mindset to teach that individual if they are not understanding a concept. Because one of our members is in the future (Florida), we must continue to properly communicate and schedule times that work for all of us.

- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

  - Non-hostile communication. Ask questions related to how they are doing project-wise, to make sure they are understanding. If they are lazy-bones, tell David.

- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

  - Continue to work on our project to the best of our abilities. Inform the instructor of the situation at hand.

## Communication Plan

  - Sarah: ANY

  - Alan: ANY

- What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

    - embrace productive conflict

## Work Plan

  - Firstly, identify the problem domain. 

  - Break down the problem domain to managable tasks.

  - assign those tasks based on team member strengths.

## Git Process

- What components of your project will live on GitHub?

  - Ensure that everything is pushed by end of day.

- How will you share the repository with your teammates?

  - We will all be contributors on the repo so that we all have permissions to freely edit.

- What is your Git flow?

  - We will frequently ACP in order to track changes and reduce the likelihood of merge conflicts.

- Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:

  - How many people must review a PR?

    - The owner of the repo is the only one who must review the PR. However, we all plan to do it together.

  - Who merges PRs?

    - The owner of the repo.

  - How often will you merge?

    - At the end of the work session.

  - How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?

    - Call a team meeting.
